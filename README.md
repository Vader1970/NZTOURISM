Project scenarios
Overview
Tourism New Zealand works with the tourism industry to positively promote New Zealand internationally. They have a new campaign that is aimed at visitors staying for short periods, booking their own accommodation and arranging their own transport.

Your task is to create a single page web application that allows users to input information, validate the information, and provide meaningful feedback when validation has failed or passed. Display accommodation or transport options to the user based on the information entered. Calculate and display either accommodation or transport costs to the user.

Tourism New Zealand want the app to have its own distinctive look and feel (whilst remaining cohesive with the Tourism New Zealand brand).

Choose one of the following:

Transport
The first part of the user experience involves visitors to a specially designed site inputting information and being shown transport options based on the number of people in their party, and the length of time they intend to be travelling.

The second part involves calculating the transport costs, including fuel consumption, based on the type of vehicle chosen and the distance to travel.

Accommodation
The first part of the user experience involves visitors to a specially designed site inputting information, and being shown accommodation options and related details, based on the number of people in their party, and the length of time they intend to be staying.

The second part involves displaying meal options for the chosen accommodation option. You will need to create the data for the meal options.
